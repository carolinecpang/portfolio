# Portfolio

Link to Website: https://caropang.github.io/portfolio/src/index



The purpose of this website is to serve as a personal portfolio to showcase my skills and interests. In particular, this website hosts information about previous technical and design projects that I’ve worked on, a small page introducing myself, as well as my resume which displays my qualifications in detail.

I decided to use a few different strategies to make my website interesting and engaging. First, I used the three.js and gsap libraries to create interesting and interactive visuals on the homepage of my website and display artwork. I used camera movement and mouse tracking to allow the users to interact with the graphics. I also added basic CSS animations throughout my website to make it more appealing. Additionally, I added a mini “shell” program in the header of my website which allows users to navigate through the website with basic Linux commands. All of the parsing and handling is coded in Javascript.

More project details can be found in write-up.pdf
