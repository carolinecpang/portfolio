                <p class="section-header">Summer 2020 • Lesson Design, Programming</p>
                <p>In Summer 2020, I had the opportunity to help develop part of the educational game library for Looma Education, a non-profit company whose mission is to harness technology to benefit schools in rural Nepal. Over the course of the summer, I lead a team of interns in designing lesson plans and accompanying multi-media presentations and also programmed games for thier game library using HTML, CSS, and JS. </p>
                <p>I primarily worked on creating English lessons and designing a language learning game. I was able to work remotely with Nepali college students and interview them about their individual experiences with the Nepali education system, their experiences teaching elementary schools students, and about other cultural differences between the US and Nepal. This helped me better design the lessons to fit the customs and cultures of Nepal.</p>
                <p class="section-header">Summer 2018 • Hardware Design</p>
                <p>Two summers prior, I worked with a partner to redesign the casing for the Looma Education computer projection system and the charge controller system. We had to take into account all of the existing hardware such as the projector, microcomputer, speakers, ports, etc.,  and design the casing to strategically and efficiently organize all of the internal components. On top of this, it was important for the design to have intuitive external controls and be easily assembled from parts. </p>
                <p>Using CAD software, we designed each piece from scratch so that every joint could seamlessly fit together. We ended up constructing 6 additional boxes by the end of the project, and this design has now been employed in over 20 schools in Nepal.</p>
